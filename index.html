            The climate emergency is here! And it is happening more quickly than most scientists anticipated a few years
            ago. The adverse effects of climate change are much more severe than expected. There is evidence that

            record, we experienced:

        <ul>
            <li>Major wildfire activity in California, Australia and in the Amazon</li>
            <li>A Siberian summer with record temperatures exceeding 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit within the Arctic circle</li>
            <li>A record low for October Arctic sea ice reach of 2.04 million square miles</li>
            <li>An Atlantic hurricane season resulting in more than $46b of damage, and</li>
            <li>Floods in South East Asia displacing more than 12 million people.</li>
        </ul>
